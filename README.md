## Description
In this project, I set up all of my software and accounts including:
- Git for version control
- Github repositories
- My server hosted by Digital Ocean
- My domain name
- SSH keys

Then I linked everything together and published a simple webpage demonstrating that my site is ready for the remainder of the course. The page includes placeholder links to future projects.
