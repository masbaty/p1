		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>
			I am taking this course to satisfy a requirement for the Web Technologies certificate, and eventually a Master's degree. I am also very interested in learning about the process of creating a website. In the short time since this course started, I have learned how to work through the command line and manage version control with Git and Github. I feel like this will be a very productive semester.
